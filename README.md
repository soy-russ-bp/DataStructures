:diamonds: [Circular array Queue error [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19758685/circular-array-queue-error)

This issue arose due to improper usage of a simple array. The user attempted to implement a generic type within an array, which is not supported in Java's behavior.To address this issue, we recommend using an ArrayList instead of an array. This allows for controlling the queue with the same behavior while retaining the generic type.
